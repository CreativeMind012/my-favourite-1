        <h1>My favourite hobby:<br /><br /> Playing Chess</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>I like to play chess as it is a sport that helps you develop your concentration and improves your level of thinking. Because it doesnâ€™t depend on age nor does it require retirement, this sport is played by people of all ages during the whole year. Chess players have been found to possess a higher spatial ability than others of comparable intelligence levels. They also possess greater physical endurance, together with tolerance of frustration. A game of chess is a manifestation of both the will to win and create beauty, with the player aiming to surmount all complexity, rigors and barriers to realise his plan and ideas. There are an indefinite amount of beautiful combinations yet to be constructed. Chess teaches independence. You are forced to make important decisions influenced only by your own judgment.</p><br /><br />
